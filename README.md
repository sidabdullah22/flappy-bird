# Flappy Bird Clone – My First Game in Unity

Welcome to my first game project! This is a simple Flappy Bird clone that I created to kickstart my **game development journey** and get familiar with the **Unity interface**, **C# scripting**, and basic game mechanics.

## Features

- Random pipe generation with vertical variation
- Game over when the bird hits an obstacle or the ground
